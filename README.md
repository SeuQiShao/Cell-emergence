## Dataset
To uncover the molecular basis that modulates the pattern of monocyte migration, we collected comprehensive data of the monocyte migration through intravital imaging under different experiments. Here, we only upload the demo dataset with our code for validation and investigation. The complete monocyte migration dataset is available after contact the corresponding authors on reasonable request.
